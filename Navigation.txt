I would like to change the layout of this site.
There are 2 different types of users logging in, Super Admins and Tenant Admins.
Tenant Admins only have access to Zones, Records and Tenant Management Page, where they can only see Tenants they have access to.
Super Admins have access to everything.
I would like there to be breadcrumb navigation at the top left of the page throughout the site such as Dashboard > Zones > example.com > Edit record
When users log in, they are directed to the dashboard which is different for Tenant Admins and Super Admins:
Tenant Admin Dashboard:
    -Since Tenant Admins just have access to management their zones, when they log in it should direct them to the Zone Management with:
    -Zones Table: Basically the same as the Zone Management page with list of forward and reverse lookup zones for their tenant.  The difference is the row for each zone will also have a DNSSEC and DDNS (Dynamic DNS) buttons in addtion to "Records"
        -User clicks on Records button for the zone, they get the Records list like they currently do
        -User clicks on the DNSSEC button and it takes them to a page to enable and manage DNSSEC records (not created yet)
        -User clicks DDNS button and they get a new page to enable DDNS and set settings for ddclient (not created yet).
    -The user menu at the top right will have the same options for Profile, Theme, Tenant Managment and Logout
Super Admin Dashboard:
    -When Super Admins log in, take them to the System Adminstration dashboard.  
    -Change the card that says User & Tenant Managment to be "DNS and Tenant Management" with buttons for:
        -DNS Management - Link to the same as Tenant Admin Dashboard with Zone table and links to manage 
        -Tenant Management - link to existin tenant management page
        -Users - Same as currently
        -Record Types - Moved over from the System Configuration section
    -System Configuration Card stays the same, except replace the moved Record Types button with the "Audit Log" button
    -Move the License Status card to be just above the System Health card.
    -Keep the Recent System Activity card, but make it full width, basically replicating the System Audit Log page showing the 10 most recent entries, then have the button at the bottom to "View all activity"
    -The Super Admin menu stays the same.

These changes make the existing dashboard unneeded.  
Basically everything related to DNS is under "Zones" to access the Records, DDNS and DNSSEC.  Then everything else is under system administration dashboard which has the link to the Zones dashboard.

You can create placeholders - we'll build them tomorrow.
Yes it should be like the zones/list.php with search and filters. Only exception is they should only be able to filter tenants they have permissions to. If they only have access to a single tenant, that filter field could be hidden.
Breadcrumb navigation can just be on the DNS management seciton with zones, zone name, records, record
Yes I think you can remove the current dashboard - all links on it are accessable from the zones management page.
The same Zones page as tenant admins, but obviously able to view zones for all tenants and filter by tenant.
I think you could put the redirect logic in the login process so the current dashboard isn't needed.
